# ConsoleRPG

This is a console RPG meant to be run in a terminal capable of Python 3.12 at least. I am learning how to code so this serves as a little bed of experimentation for a few things as I work towards my primary goal of coding a MUD using the Evennia engine.

If you follow this code please feel free to give feedback and thoughts. I appreciate the collaborative input of my peers as long as it remains respectful. Thank you!
